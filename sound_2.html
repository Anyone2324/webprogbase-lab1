    <h3>Green Day - Boulevard of Broken Dreams</h3>
    <p class="sound-info">
      Boulevard of Broken Dreams (Russian Boulevard of Broken Dreams) is the second single of the American rock band Green Day
      from the album American Idiot. The song was written by Green Day, on the words of vocalist Billy Joe Armstrong. The
      song itself is one of the "calling cards" of the group. The lyric hero of the song is the main character of the album
      American Idiot, Jesus from the suburbs (Jesus of Suburbia). The lyrics of the song are sullen, gloomy, the pace is
      moderate, average. The song contrasts with the previous track on the album, "Holiday", where Jesus has fun in the city.
      In the special issue of MTV Making the Video "Holiday" is described as a party, and "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" as
      a subsequent hangover.
